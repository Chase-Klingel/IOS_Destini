This was the first Swift app I created where I had to take concepts I had learned in previous built apps (notably IOS_Dicee) and apply those same concepts to buid a story app. The main idea with this app was to: 

1. practice conditionals in swift, 
2. hook into tags
3. keep track of state based on user input.
