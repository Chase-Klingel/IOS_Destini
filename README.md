This was the first Swift app I created where I had to take concepts I had learned in previous built apps (notably IOS_Dicee) and apply those same concepts to buid a story app. The main idea with this app was to practice: 

1. conditional logic 
2. hook into tags
3. keep track of state based on user input
4. use principles of OOP 
5. Utilize the MVC architectural pattern
